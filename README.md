# gdscript-preprocessor

An export plugin for stripping comments and "conditional compilation" of GDScript.

Version: **1.0-dev**. Compatible with Godot **4.2.x**. Status: should be ready
for production use. Please report if you find any bugs.

## How to use

1. Copy the `addons/gdscript_preprocessor` folder to your project.
2. Enable the plugin in the Project Settings.
3. Export the project.

The original scripts will not be changed, but in PCK/ZIP the scripts will be changed.
Use ZIP to check to check the result. If any errors occurred during the export,
you will see them in the Output Log.

## Settings

You can change the settings in the Options tab of the Export dialog:

## Important note

Each supported platform has certain standard feature tags (plus any custom tags you specify
in the export preset). However, there are some standard tags that are not known in advance.
See [godotengine/godot#76990](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/76990) and
[godotengine/godot#76996](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/76996) for details.

You can specify a list of feature tags that will be treated as dynamic in the export options.

## Features

* Stripping comments.
* Conditional compilation directives (`#~if` and `#~endif`). They work only when exporting
  a project, and have no effect in the editor.
* `if`/`elif`/`else` statements if their conditions contain only `true`, `false`, `and`,
  `or`, `not` and the following functions calls:
  * `Engine.is_editor_hint()`;
  * `OS.is_debug_build()`;
  * `OS.has_feature("feature_tag_name")`.
* Removing statements by regular expression. With default settings, `assert()`, `breakpoint`,
  `print_debug()`, and `print_stack()` are removed in release builds. Also, you can specify
  custom regexes in the export options.

## Limitations

* Built-in scripts are not supported.
* Your code is expected to follow the
  [GDScript style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html).
  Otherwise, regular expressions and string processing used in the plugin may not work.
* Statements inside lambdas are not processed (except stripping comments).
* No control flow analysis is performed. For example, an early `return` with a constant condition
  will not strip the rest of the function body. However, you can use the preprocessor directives.

## Example

Original script:

```gdscript
extends Node


var a: int
#~if OS.has_feature("debug")
var b: int
#~endif
var c: int


## Comment.
func _ready() -> void:
    # Comment.
    print(1)
    if OS.has_feature("debug"):
        var t: int = a + b
        print("Debug: t = ", t)
    elif OS.has_feature("release"):
        print("Release.")
    else:
        print("Impossible?!")
    print(2)
```

After exporting with the `debug` feature tag:

```gdscript
extends Node
var a: int
var b: int
var c: int
func _ready() -> void:
    print(1)
    if true:
        var t: int = a + b
        print("Debug: t = ", t)
    print(2)
```

After exporting with the `release` feature tag:

```gdscript
extends Node
var a: int
var c: int
func _ready() -> void:
    print(1)
    if true:
        print("Release.")
    print(2)
```
